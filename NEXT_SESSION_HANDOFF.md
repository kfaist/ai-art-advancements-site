# 🎯 AI Art Advancements Site - Session Handoff

## 📊 CURRENT STATUS (as of Oct 8, 2025)

### ✅ CONFIRMED WORKING
- **GitHub Repository EXISTS**: https://github.com/kfaist/ai-art-advancements-site
- **Code is uploaded** to GitHub (visible in repo)
- **OpenAI API Key** is configured in local `.env` file (verified present)
- **Project structure** is complete locally at: `C:\Users\Krista\Desktop\ai-art-advancements-site`
- **Dependencies** are ready (package.json configured with all scripts)
- **GitHub Actions workflows** are configured:
  - `daily-content.yml` - Scheduled content generation (9 AM & 11 AM EST)
  - `deploy.yml` - GitHub Pages deployment
- **OPENAI_API_KEY secret** is added to GitHub repo settings
- **Git is installed** locally (version 2.51.0)

### ⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUE DISCOVERED
**Local directory is NOT git-initialized** - The local folder does not have a `.git` folder, meaning:
- Cannot push changes from local to GitHub
- Cannot pull updates from GitHub to local  
- Git commands will fail from this directory

**What this means**: Code was likely uploaded via web interface, but local directory needs reconnection.

### ❓ NEEDS VERIFICATION  
- [ ] GitHub Pages status (https://kfaist.github.io/ai-art-advancements-site/)
- [ ] Whether `gh-pages` branch exists
- [ ] If any workflows have run successfully
- [ ] Whether automated schedules are active

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS (Priority Order)

### STEP 1: Reconnect Local to GitHub ⚡ CRITICAL
```powershell
cd C:\Users\Krista\Desktop\ai-art-advancements-site

# Initialize git
git init

# Add remote (already exists on GitHub)  
git remote add origin https://github.com/kfaist/ai-art-advancements-site.git

# Fetch current state
git fetch origin

# Set up tracking
git branch -M main
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main

# Pull latest code (may have conflicts to resolve)
git pull origin main

# Verify connection
git remote -v
git status
```

### STEP 2: Verify GitHub Pages Deployment
```powershell
# Check in browser:
# https://kfaist.github.io/ai-art-advancements-site/

# Or check GitHub settings:
# https://github.com/kfaist/ai-art-advancements-site/settings/pages

# What to verify:
# - Source should be "GitHub Actions" or "Deploy from branch: gh-pages"
# - Build and deployment should show recent activity
```

### STEP 3: Test Content Generation Locally
```powershell
cd C:\Users\Krista\Desktop\ai-art-advancements-site

# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Test each script
npm run daily-news
npm run nonprofit-news
npm run generate-instagram

# Check outputs were created
ls content/
ls instagram-generator/drafts/
```

### STEP 4: Trigger First Workflow Run
```powershell
# Via GitHub web:
# 1. Go to: https://github.com/kfaist/ai-art-advancements-site/actions
# 2. Click "Daily Content Generation" workflow
# 3. Click "Run workflow" dropdown → "Run workflow" button
# 4. Watch it execute in real-time

# Via command line (if you install GitHub CLI):
# gh workflow run daily-content.yml
# gh run watch
```

### STEP 5: Verify Everything is Working
```powershell
# Check Actions ran successfully
# https://github.com/kfaist/ai-art-advancements-site/actions

# Check site is live
# https://kfaist.github.io/ai-art-advancements-site/

# Check new content was committed
git log --oneline -5
```

## 📋 AVAILABLE NPM COMMANDS

```powershell
npm run dev              # Start local dev server (http://localhost:4321)
npm run build            # Build for production
npm run preview          # Preview production build
npm run daily-news       # Generate daily AI art news

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### If git pull fails with conflicts:
```powershell
# See what conflicts exist
git status

# If you want to keep remote version
git reset --hard origin/main

# If you want to merge carefully
git merge origin/main
# (resolve conflicts manually, then)
git add .
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
```

### If workflows aren't running:
1. Check Actions tab for errors
2. Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY` secret is set correctly
3. Check repo has Actions enabled (Settings → Actions → General)
4. Ensure workflows have correct permissions (read/write)

### If site isn't deploying:
1. Check Pages settings (Settings → Pages)
2. Verify `gh-pages` branch exists or Actions deployment is selected
3. Check workflow logs for build errors
4. Wait 5-10 minutes after first push (deployment takes time)

### If OpenAI API calls fail:
```powershell
# Test API key locally
node test-openai.js

# Check OpenAI usage/limits
# https://platform.openai.com/usage
```
