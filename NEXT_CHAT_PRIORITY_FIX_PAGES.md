---

## 🔧 FIX GITHUB PAGES - Step by Step

### Step 1: Check GitHub Pages Settings

1. Go to: https://github.com/kfaist/ai-art-advancements-site/settings/pages
2. Check what "Source" is currently set to
3. Take a screenshot or note the settings

### Step 2: Verify Workflow Files Exist

Check if these workflow files exist in the repo:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\Krista\Desktop\ai-art-advancements-site
dir .github\workflows
```

Look for:
- `deploy.yml` or `pages.yml` or similar
- `daily-news.yml`
- `nonprofit-news.yml`

### Step 3: Check GitHub Actions Status

Go to: https://github.com/kfaist/ai-art-advancements-site/actions

Look for:
- ❌ Failed workflows (click to see errors)
- ⚠️ No workflows running
- ⏸️ Workflows disabled

### Step 4: Common 404 Fixes

**Option A: Deploy from Branch (Simpler)**
1. Settings → Pages
2. Source: **Deploy from a branch**
3. Branch: Select **main** and **/ (root)**
4. Save
5. Wait 3-5 minutes, refresh site

**Option B: GitHub Actions (Astro Default)**
1. Settings → Pages
2. Source: **GitHub Actions**
3. Push a commit to trigger deployment:
```powershell
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger Pages deployment"
git push origin main
```
4. Go to Actions tab, watch for "pages build and deployment"
5. Wait for green checkmark

**Option C: Create gh-pages Branch**
```powershell
# If gh-pages branch doesn't exist
git checkout -b gh-pages
npm run build
git add dist -f
git commit -m "Deploy to gh-pages"
git push origin gh-pages

# Then in Settings → Pages, select gh-pages branch
```

### Step 5: Check Repository Settings

Go to: https://github.com/kfaist/ai-art-advancements-site/settings

Verify:
- ✅ Repository is **Public** (Pages doesn't work on private repos without Pro)
- ✅ Actions → General → Workflow permissions: **Read and write permissions**
- ✅ Actions → General → Allow GitHub Actions: **All actions and reusable workflows**

---

## 🎯 DEBUGGING CHECKLIST

Run through these one by one:

```powershell
# 1. Check what branch you're on
git branch

# 2. Check if there are uncommitted changes
git status

# 3. Check last commit
git log --oneline -1

# 4. Check if main branch exists on remote
git ls-remote --heads origin

# 5. Check astro.config.mjs base path
type astro.config.mjs | findstr base
```

**Expected base path in astro.config.mjs:**
```javascript
base: '/ai-art-advancements-site'
```

---

## 🔍 LIKELY CAUSES OF 404

1. **No deployment workflow triggered**
   - Solution: Push a commit or trigger manually

2. **Wrong Pages source setting**
   - Solution: Set to GitHub Actions or main branch

3. **Missing/incorrect base path in astro.config**
   - Solution: Verify base: '/ai-art-advancements-site'

4. **Workflow permissions issue**
   - Solution: Enable read/write in Actions settings

5. **Build failing silently**
   - Solution: Check Actions tab for errors

6. **Repository is private**
   - Solution: Make public or upgrade to GitHub Pro

Hi Claude! Continuing AI Art Advancements Site - PRIORITY: Fix GitHub Pages 404

VERIFIED STATUS:
✅ Git connected: https://github.com/kfaist/ai-art-advancements-site
✅ Local directory: C:\Users\Krista\Desktop\ai-art-advancements-site
✅ All files present
❌ CRITICAL ISSUE: GitHub Pages 404 for 2+ hours (previous attempts looped)

IMMEDIATE PRIORITY:
1. Fix GitHub Pages 404 at https://kfaist.github.io/ai-art-advancements-site/
2. Check Pages settings, workflow status, and deployment logs
3. Verify astro.config.mjs has correct base path
4. Get site live before moving to content generation

AFTER PAGES IS WORKING:
5. Set up .env with OpenAI API key
6. Test content generation locally
7. Trigger workflows manually
8. Verify content appears on live site

Please help me systematically debug why Pages isn't deploying. I have the handoff document with all troubleshooting steps.
```

## 📁 Files to Check in Next Session

1. **astro.config.mjs** - Verify base path
2. **.github/workflows/*.yml** - Check workflow syntax
3. **package.json** - Verify build scripts
4. **GitHub Settings → Pages** - Current configuration
5. **GitHub Actions tab** - Any failed runs

---

## 🎨 After Pages is Fixed, Then Content Generation

Once the site is live, proceed with:

1. **Add OpenAI API key to .env**
2. **Test locally:** `npm run daily-news`
3. **Generate Instagram content**
4. **Add GitHub secret:** `OPENAI_API_KEY`
5. **Trigger workflow manually**
6. **Verify content on live site**

---

## 💡 Quick Win Test

Try this manual deployment approach:

```powershell
# Build the site locally
npm run build

# Check if dist folder was created
dir dist

# If dist exists, try deploying to gh-pages
git checkout -b gh-pages
copy dist\* . /Y
git add .
git commit -m "Manual deployment test"
git push origin gh-pages -f

# Then set Pages to deploy from gh-pages branch
```

---

## ✅ Success Will Look Like:

- 🌐 https://kfaist.github.io/ai-art-advancements-site/ loads without 404
- 🏠 Homepage displays correctly
- 📄 Navigation works
- 🎨 Styling loads properly

---

**Good luck fixing the 404! The site structure is solid, just needs the deployment configuration corrected.**
